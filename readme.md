## Project Goals
   - The goal of this project is to predict which songs are 
    classified as a "Hit" and which songs are classified as a "Flop'. 
    If the model is successfull, playlist curators and radio program directors 
    can use it as a tool to identify what music has the potential to appeal to a mainstream audience.
